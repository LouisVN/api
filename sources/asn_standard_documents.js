          "The WVBE and the WVDE are pleased to present Policy 2520.3C, The Next Generation Content Standards and Objectives for Science in West Virginia Schools. West Virginia educators, including regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, teachers representing higher education institutions, and informal science educators convened to revise the content standards and objectives; they played a key role in shaping the content standards to align with national standards and rigorous national assessments. The committees considered major advances in science, research from the American Association for Advancement in Science and the National Research Council, and their understanding of how students learn science as decisions were made regarding science content, science and engineering practices, cross-cutting concepts, the nature of science, science literacy and the sequencing of standards. The contribution of these professionals was critical in creating a policy that is meaningful to classroom teachers and appears in a format that can easily be understood and used."

          "The new social studies frameworks are designed to assist curriculum writers at the district level as they write or revise the social studies curriculum for their districts. This document is not intended to be a state curriculum. In a \"local control\" state such as Connecticut, each district can use the document as it sees fit. However, there is much that is new and exciting in these frameworks, and it is highly recommended that this document be used as a model of curriculum change in any district."

          "In Grades K-6, students develop skills and foundational knowledge in geography as well as civics, economics, and history. Grade 7 Social Studies provides a study of both physical and human geography of the world through a geographic lens. As students study the continents and regions across the globe, they will learn about the historic, cultural, economic, and political development as well as interconnections that occur in both human and physical systems of each area. During this study, students will develop the perspective of a global citizen, understanding that global-scale issues and problems are resolved through extensive collaboration among the world's peoples, nations, and economic organizations. Geographic inquiry helps students understand and appreciate their own place in the world and fosters curiosity about Earth's wide diversity of environments and cultures. Geography requires using spatial and environmental perspectives, asking and answering questions about global interconnections and spatial patterns, and applying geographic skills and tools. Creating maps and other geographic representations promotes the inquiry process and can be useful in making decisions and solving problems. This course helps students understand that thinking geographically requires knowing that the world is a set of complex ecosystems interacting at multiple scales that structure the spatial patterns and processes influencing our daily lives."

          "Stagecraft I is a two-semester course which provides students with both exposure to and experience in all elements of technical theatre, including scenery, props, lighting, sound, costume, and makeup. The four strands emphasize creating, performing/presenting, responding and connecting. In Creating, students generate ideas and original tangible works. In Performing and Presenting, students perform tasks associated with technical theatre and present their work to others. Through Responding, students examine works already created by themselves, their peers, or others to analyze the artistic merit and refine work. Through Connecting, students discover connections between theatrical works and historical, societal, and cultural context. Stagecraft I contains foundational elements of theatre that are not developed in Stagecraft II and III, but the teacher may choose to draw student learning expectations from the Drama II-III Curriculum Framework. Stagecraft II is a two-semester course which allows students to advance their skills in all elements of technical theatre through practical experience, with new instruction in design. Stagecraft III is a two-semester course which allows students to deepen their understanding and advance their skills in specialized elements of technical theatre, which could include scenery, props, lighting, sound, costume, and/or makeup. Stagecraft I fulfills the one-half unit of fine arts credit required for graduation. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Stagecraft I, Stagecraft II, or Stagecraft III."

          "Science education in Vermont is currently centered on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), which were adopted by the Vermont State Board of Education in June 2013. These science standards guide classroom instruction to incorporate science content (Disciplinary Core Ideas), relevant practices (Science and Engineering Practices) and unifying authentic ideas (Crosscutting Concepts). The domains of science addressed by this document include Physical Science, Life Science, Earth/Space Science and Engineering Design. Assessment of student understanding of these domains is accomplished through statewide assessment, as well a continuation of ongoing local and classroom assessments. Professional development through the Science Professional Learning Team supports classroom instruction to provide effective science learning for all Vermont students."

Because it is built on the middle grades standards, this is a more ambitious version of Algebra I than has generally been offered. The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations."

However, it is not necessary for the whole set of health science to be used a measure of a course or program's completeness. Rather, distinctive conversations and informed decisions with involvement of multiple stakeholders, including business/industry and postsecondary representation, should be made regarding what is and what is not covered in a course, a sequence of courses, or a program.

Each standard is an overarching statement of content, to which we have attached multiple age-appropriate benchmarks as a means of evaluating students' mastery. To make the standards as accessible as possible, they have been designed to apply to all socioeconomic student groups. The standards do not assume prior economic or financial knowledge and are written in deliberately nontechnical language so that they can be taught by teachers who are not trained in personal finance and economics."

This course will emphasize the development and maturation of the British colonies, and the political, cultural, and economic influences that led to the American Revolution. The major events and outcomes of the American Revolution will be analyzed, along with the individuals that played influential roles in the development of the new nation. Students will follow the development of the United States and its government, continuing through the early 19th century. The impact of the expansion of the United States will be analyzed, including implications on domestic and foreign policy. Policies that affected the American Indians will also be studied. The events leading up to the Civil War will be examined, along with the individuals and events that were significant during the war. The history, people, government, and geography of Tennessee will be emphasized in order to illustrate the role our state has played in American history. Reconstruction and the development of the American West will conclude this course.

However, the full scope of a set of standards should not be used as a measure of a course or program's completeness. Rather, distinctive conversations and informed decisions with involvement of multiple stakeholders, including business/industry and postsecondary representation, should be made regarding what is and what is not covered in a course, a sequence of courses or a program.

The goal of this course is to broaden the knowledge and understandings of students interested in learning about the histories, cultures, legacies and achievements of American Indians from prehistoric to present-day societies. The course offers traditional and contemporary perspectives, which place the land, its history, and the people at the center. The course will emphasize interactions between and within American Indian groups as well as with the government of the United States. The course draws upon concepts and issues of policy, law, economic and cultural change as well as shared beliefs concerning human-environment interaction. Students will be able to immerse themselves in some of America's oldest continuous societies and cultures, within a learning environment which fosters open, critical and creative historical thought. Although the many American Indian groups of North Carolina are encouraged to be used as the focus of instructional content examples, the expectation of the course is to expose students to American Indian societies and tribes from all areas of the United States throughout history."

New technologies are also constantly reshaping the boundaries and skill sets of many arts career pathways. Consequently, core arts-sector occupations demand constantly varying combinations of artistic imagination, metaphoric representation, symbolic connections, and technical skills. The anchor and pathway standards make explicit the appropriate knowledge, skills, and practical experience students should have in order to pursue their chosen profession, whether that profession requires postsecondary education, graduate training, or apprenticeship."

Students will learn how mathematical topics such as graph theory, planning and scheduling, group decision making, fair division, game theory, and theory of moves can be applied to management and decision making. Students will research mathematicians of the past whose work is relevant to these topics today and read articles about current mathematicians who either teach and conduct research at major universities or work in business and industry solving real-world logistical problems. Through the study of the applications of mathematics to society's problems today, students will become better prepared for and gain an appreciation for the value of a career in mathematics."

They are not intended to represent the full curriculum for instruction and assessment locally, nor are they meant to simply replace existing social studies curriculum. The set of GSEs includes concepts and skills intended to be for local assessment purposes only. Generally speaking, Grade Span Expectations – at any grade – represent content knowledge and skills that have been introduced instructionally at least one to two years before students are expected to demonstrate confidence in applying them independently."

The study of Environment and Ecology will allow students to be active participants and problem solvers in real issues that affect them, their homes, schools and communities. The very interdisciplinary nature of this field allows teachers and students to use science, technology and social systems as the vehicles to a better tomorrow through the Environment and Ecology Standards. With the addition of PreK-3 Environment and Ecology Standards, it is suggested that Grade 1 focus on terrestrial habitats; Grade 2 focus on aquatic habitats; and Grade 3 focus on wetland habitats."

Our belief is that quality instruction in the arts shall be provided by arts specialists and classroom teachers and supported by partnerships with professional organizations and community programs in the arts. This partnered instruction will enhance both student literacy and meaningful, purposeful, and enjoyable educational learning opportunities. It will also support student preparation for life as a contributing 21st-century citizen. We further believe that the arts integrate with all other subject areas to create learning opportunities for all learners that communicate achievement, respect, freedom, and fun.\""

Also in 2007, coordinated school health stakeholders recommended the development of grade-level expectations (GLEs) for health and PE. GLEs have been developed for core content subjects to develop grade-by-grade standards to guide the development of curriculum, instruction, and assessment and to provide uniformity in subject content taught across Louisiana. Therefore, the Department of Education chose to develop GLEs to achieve the charge of developing curricula in health and PE."

          "Teachers today must prepare students for a world of possibilities that may not currently exist. The workforce of tomorrow must be flexible, motivated, and be able to draw from a deep and vast skill set. Arizona's Common Core Standards in mathematics provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn, so teachers and parents know what how to support them. The standards are focused, coherent, and relevant to the real world, describing the knowledge and skills that students need for success in college and careers. By setting high expectations with a commitment to succeed with all students, we are positioning our future workforce to be internationally competitive."

          "The Nevada English Language Arts Standards are intended to give Nevada children the tools and experiences that will help them not only to succeed in school but also to become lifelong and adept readers, writers, listeners, and speakers. The scope of English language arts study extends far beyond the English language arts classroom. Students apply the skills learned there in every content area; for example, students write science reports and make presentations in social studies classes. It is the same with research. While students often gain their research skills through instruction in the English language arts, the practice of those skills spans many content areas. Technology tools used within the English language arts classroom to enhance productivity, communication, and research can assist students as they construct models, prepare publications, and produce other creative works. Many of the standards set out for younger students are on the surface similar to those written for high school students. What changes between the sets of expectations is the developmental abilities of students to, for example, write more sophisticated compositions or to read more complex texts."

Vital to implementing these standards is the ability to teach using appropriate strategies. The foremost goal for West Virginia's children is to be lifelong learners. Young children live in a society where information is constantly changing and the ability to function well in an increasingly global economy is essential. Children must have the ability to continuously learn. Therefore, it is essential that children develop skills which allow them to become competent, independent learners capable of higher intellectual functions. To fulfill this role, teachers of young children must also be lifelong learners, continuously building their professional knowledge and functional competencies based on current research."

It links health education to other education reform efforts which seek to improve teaching and learning and contribute to high levels of achievement for all students. This framework does not take the place of, or in any way diminish, the legal health education requirements each school district must meet. Rather it offers a lens through which we can better focus on the teaching and learning of health that will carry our children into the next century. The seven Rhode Island standards for health education state what all Rhode Island students should know and be able to do as a result of K - 12 health education. The performance descriptions elaborating the standards suggest how students at various grade levels can demonstrate movement along the continuum to the eventual achievement of each standard. These descriptions do not preclude the development of additional and/or alternative performance descriptions at the district, building or class level."

Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

          "This geography course will emphasize the increasing interconnectedness of Earth's people due to globalization, as well as, the notion of \"spatial variation\"—how and why things differ from place to place both physically and culturally on the earth's surface. Globalization is the ongoing process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among humankind. While its origins are debatable, this process has been significantly amplified with the onset of new communication technologies that have improved economic, political, social, cultural, historic, and geographic connections among individuals, groups, and nations. The mounting flow of goods, services, finances, ideas, and people across national and international borders has created a world ever more devoid of physical and political boundaries and dependent upon empathy and collaboration. Since the consequences of the process are not predetermined, an awareness of the positive or negative possibilities of these connections is paramount to individual improvement and the advancement of humanity."

The standards were updated for all grades, K – 12, and were aligned to the 2007 National Health Education Standards. Early drafts of the updated standards were reviewed by teachers, community health educators and university health education faculty. The standards were also posted online for review by Indiana teachers, administrators, school nurses, parents, physicians and community members. In the final step, the updated standards were again reviewed by national content reviewers for content, rigor, specificity, and comprehensiveness."

          "Health literacy, considered a 21st Century theme by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills, is, \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\" (Nielsen-Bohlman, 2004). A health literate person is able to make appropriate decisions about their health as he or she progresses through life, as health care changes, and as societal norms change. The benefits of being health literate influence the full range of life's activities—home, school, work, society and culture (Zarcadoolas, 2005)."

          "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

Students learn to examine the inherent relationship between costs and benefits, and the values associated with them. An understanding of economic principles, whole economies, and the interactions between different types of economies helps students comprehend the movement and exchange of information, capital, and products across the globe. Citizens need to be able to assess the impact of market influences and governmental actions on the economy in which they live. The study of economics equips them to make personal economic choices, and to participate responsibly and effectively in social decision-making as citizens in an increasingly competitive and interdependent global economy."

The Big Ideas are conceptual organizers for health and physical education and are the same at each grade level. This ensures students have multiple opportunities throughout their school careers to develop skills and concepts linked to the Big Ideas. Under each Big Idea are statements of Enduring Knowledge/Understandings that represent overarching generalizations linked to health and physical education. The understandings represent the desired results-what learning will focus upon and what knowledge students will be able to explain or apply. Understandings can be used to frame development of units of study and lessons plans. Skills and Concepts describe the ways that students demonstrate their learning and are specific to each grade level. The skills and concepts for health and physical education are fundamental to health literacy and build on prior learning."

          "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

All physical phenomena and human activities exist in space as well as time. Geography studies the relationships of people, places, and environments from the perspective of where they occur, why they are there, and what meaning those locations have for us. Citizens with the knowledge and perspectives of geography understand the environmental and human processes that shape the Earth's surface, and recognize the culturally distinctive ways people interact with the natural world to produce unique places. An appreciation of the nature of their world and their place in it will better prepare citizens for a physical environment more threatened and a global economy more competitive and interconnected."

They practice the skills of gathering historical data, and examining, analyzing, and interpreting these data. They learn to organize events through chronologies, and to suggest and evaluate cause-and-effect relationships among those events. Before choosing a position or acting, citizens need to be able to research issues in order to understand the effect of historical developments and trends on contemporary events.

          "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

Turning points chosen for this course do not need to be events that have been popularly discussed in the standard United States History survey course. They should be \"off-centered\" to allow students an opportunity to study, in depth, a potentially fresh topic in United States History. Thus, the Mexican War could be a turning point of emphasis, instead of a better known war, such as the Civil War."

          "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

The course should begin with an understanding of America's founding documents—The Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution—and the conceptual and historical paradoxes of each. A foundation of the course should be an understanding of Jefferson's creed that \"...all men are created equal...,\" as well as, the document's interpretation and applicability over the course of the Twentieth Century. The course should also emphasize the flexibility of the U.S. Constitution, and specifically the impact of additional amendments over time and their varying interpretations on both civil liberties and civil rights during the Twentieth Century. The thrust of the course should be the historical narrative of a people who persevered to give greater meaning to our founding creed and those founding American documents. This story would include the twentieth century social movements for greater freedom and equality led by and for various groups of Americans. Because of past and current global calls for universal human rights based on Jefferson's ideals, this course should promote the interconnected civil liberties and civil rights narrative of a people, a nation, and a world."

          "Mathematics in Colorado's description of 21st century skills is a synthesis of the essential abilities students must apply in our rapidly changing world. Today's mathematics students need a repertoire of knowledge and skills that are more diverse, complex, and integrated than any previous generation. Three themes are used to describe these important skills and competencies and are interwoven throughout the standards: inquiry questions; relevance and application; and the nature of each discipline. These competencies should not be thought of stand-alone concepts, but should be integrated throughout the curriculum in all grade levels. Just as it is impossible to teach thinking skills to students without the content to think about, it is equally impossible for students to understand the content of a discipline without grappling with complex questions and the investigation of topics."

Because the standards are consensus statements about what an education in the arts should contain, they provide a basis for student assessment and program evaluation. The standards support the arts in the ―academic standing in that mere participation is not the same as education. The standards affirm that discipline and rigor are critical to high academic achievement. Academic achievement, knowledge, and skills can be measured in the arts– if not always on a numerical scale, then by informed critical judgment. Performance-based assessment has long been used in the arts that include the practice of portfolio review in the visual arts and the assessment of performance skills through auditions used in dance, music, and theatre."

Students demonstrate competence and confidence in a variety of genres and styles. They perform across cultural and professional boundaries. They communicate and inspire. They take responsibility and show initiative at the expected moment. Investigating the meanings and significance of the works of artists, choreographers, and technicians across time and space provides for the examination of ideas across disciplines. Students connect the concepts of dance to history, science, politics, religion, literature, drama, music, visual arts, and physical fitness. Dance can provide connections with any subject matter and help students to understand concepts important in other disciplines. Analyzing and critiquing dances — past and present — supports understanding of the relevance of the work in its time and culture."

Listening to, analyzing, and the evaluation of music are important building blocks of musical learning. Broad experience with a variety of music is necessary if students are to make informed musical judgments. This breadth of background enables students to begin to understand the connections and relationships between music and other disciplines. The study of music is a product of its time and place, although some works transcend their original settings and continue to appeal to humans through their timeless and universal attraction. To participate fully in a diverse, global society, students must understand their own historical and cultural heritage and those of others within their communities and beyond."

Students will critically review literature on their chosen research problem, design and conduct a long-term study, and report the results. Students will participate in on-going peer reviews that will help students refine their research protocol, analysis, and conclusions. There will be two culminating evaluative processes. First, students will present their findings at a \"board review\" at the local school, before teachers, parents, and a panel of \"science experts.\" Second, students will present their research in one of several formats such as the following: at a regional or national meeting; as part of regional or national competition, e.g., Science and Engineering Fair, FIRST Robotics, or selected Science Olympiad events; or state, regional, or national publication."

The standards are not the curriculum. The standards do not specify courses, teaching methods, or instructional materials. We are currently providing the grade level standards as guidance. Sequencing of instruction and choice of curriculum are local decisions. The purpose of the standards is solely to specify what students are to know and be able to do as a result of science instruction."

Geology can serve students who have both science and non-science emphasis in their course work. The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic understanding of geology, geologic processes and how geology impacts our society. The curriculum investigates the Earth's formation, Earth materials and processes, available and important resources, changing landscapes and climate, catastrophic events, and society's attempt to deal with our ever changing world. Students can make real-world connections by examining our role in the solar system, man's effect upon our mineral and rock resources, seismic events, landforms and how a changing climate has the ability to alter life as we know it, thus applying their knowledge to these real-world situations."

Students will learn that Earth is a dynamic system and Earth's atmosphere is a result of processes that took millions of years. The learner then takes this knowledge of the composition and characteristics of Earth's atmosphere, and transfers it to delve into the factors that can cause short term and long term changes in Earth's atmospheric conditions. Students will learn that the Earth is an interacting system of both energy and matter. To understand the interaction, students must build on prior knowledge of matter and the factors the affect its behavior. In addition, throughout this course students will use science inquiry skills, manipulation of appropriate lab equipment and demonstration of appropriate safety practice."

Students practice using a set of tools for analyzing choices of all types, including those related to personal finance. Students learn the benefits of compound interest over time and that poor money management can lead to difficulty in obtaining credit. Students practice weighing costs and benefits of options when making choices about such things as careers, insurance, housing, investments, savings, automobiles and health care. Students practice these skills as they extend their understanding of the essential knowledge defined by the Standards of Learning for Economics and Personal Finance."

These discernments are intrinsic to the promotion, nurture and development of divergence in thought making and processing because they kindle the brain functions that spark innovation. When artists engage in the cognitive and experiential maneuvers provided by the visual arts, they are able to transform, reorganize, and transfer understanding into personal renderings and interpretations of the world around them. Verbal, logical, and number-sense brain functions are enhanced and accentuated by arts experiences, making the arts the \"genius\" centers for learning in the human brain. Contemporary brain research supports the notion of \"genius\" generated by arts experiences because of their direct impact on activating these brain functions."

High school standards are delineated as Dance 1, Dance 2, Dance 3, and Dance 4. This design provides flexibility for dance teachers so that they may differentiate instruction within any given class or grade based on a student's prior experiences with dance. It also enables flexibility for the variety of class schedules found in high schools and the mixed grades that occur within the study of dance."

          "The 2009 Minnesota Academic Standards in Science set the expectations for achievement in science for K-12 students in Minnesota. The standards are grounded in the belief that all students can and should be scientifically literate. Scientific literacy enables people to use scientific principles and processes to make personal decisions and to participate in discussions of scientific issues that affect society (NRC, 1996). The standards and benchmarks describe a connected body of science and engineering knowledge acquired through active participation in science experiences. These experiences include hands-on laboratory activities rooted in scientific inquiry and engineering design. The standards are placed at the grade level where mastery is expected with recognition that a progression of learning experiences in earlier grades builds the foundation for mastery later on."

          "Nutrition education has the potential to improve student's consumer and health literacy, which are critical 21st century skills, and contributes to the development of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. Students learn to choose healthy foods through effective nutrition education. Teaching nutrition can improve students' eating habits, but students need consistent messages that build on skills already in place. Developing sound nutritional and exercise habits early in life will help children become healthy adults. This is one of the most important life skills that we can teach our students, and requires a comprehensive approach to be effective. Teachers can use the nutrition education standards as a framework to develop age-appropriate lessons that are consistent in scope and sequence."

Schools can better achieve their basic educational mission if students are healthy and fit physically, mentally, socially, and emotionally. Habits that young people establish will impact their future health status in a positive or negative manner. Schools share the responsibility with parents and communities to help prevent unnecessary injury, disease, and chronic health conditions that lead to a low quality of life, disability, or early death. In addition, positive attitudes and behaviors developed early in life help to prevent many of the social and educational problems that confront society, including failure to complete high school, drug addiction, broken homes, unemployment, and criminal behavior."

Students will compare the Earth's properties with those of the other planets and explore how the heavens have influenced human thought and action. The course gives a description of astronomical phenomena using the laws of physics. The course treats many standard topics including planets, stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies, black holes to more esoteric questions concerning the origin of the universe and its evolution and fate. Although largely descriptive, the course will occasionally require the use of sophomore-high level mathematics. Laboratory exercises include experiments in light properties, measurement of radiation from celestial sources, and observations at local observatories and/or planetariums"

          "Performing, creating, and responding to music are essential parts of the school curriculum because they are fundamental processes in which human beings engage. Because music is a basic expression of human culture, every student must have access to a balanced comprehensive and sequential program of study in music during the school day, including the opportunity to perform and attend performances. Singing, playing instruments, moving to music, and creating music enables students to acquire musical skills and knowledge that can be developed in no other way. Learning to read and notate music gives them skills to explore music independently. Listening to, analyzing, and evaluating music are important building blocks of musical learning. To relate to a diverse, global society, students must understand historical and cultural heritage."

In 1998-1999, representatives from each of the districts participated in regional groups along with community college, University, and business representatives.

National standards and several states' standards were referenced to establish the rigor of the Wyoming Social Studies Content and Performance Standards."

They are not intended to represent the full curriculum for instruction and assessment locally, nor are they meant to simply replace existing social studies curriculum.

          "Policy 2520.55 is organized around the three major components of a standards-based curriculum: learning standards, instructional objectives and performance descriptors. The learning standards are the broad descriptions of what all students must know and be able to do at the conclusion of the instructional sequence. The accompanying grade-level objectives are specific descriptors of knowledge, skills and attitudes that when mastered will enable the student to attain the standard. The instructional objectives guide instructional planning and provide a basis for determining appropriate assessments, instructional strategies and resources. The performance descriptors provide the basis for assessing overall student competence of grade level standards. The performance descriptors define the five student performance levels ranging from novice to distinguished. With the ultimate goal of \"learning for all,\" these descriptors allow the teacher, students and parents to judge the level of student proficiency in each 21st century learning standard."

          "The development of the ISLLC (Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium) in 1996 was a milestone in helping states and school districts define how leaders can positively influence learning and establishing guidelines to ensure that they do so. More than 40 states have since adopted the ISLLC standards or used them as the basis for their own standards. In many of those states, the standards are playing an important role in informing key policies affecting the training, licensing, induction, professional development and evaluation of school leaders. With Wallace support, these guidelines have been revised by the Council of Chief State School Officers, applying the growth in knowledge about effective leadership practices over the last decade. This publication spells out the changes and their significance for improving leadership policy and practice."

Theatre electives must be offered to accommodate at least one level of student achievement (Theatre I). Electives must be provided to accommodate four sequential levels of student achievement (Theatre I - IV). The number of class periods for which theatre is offered will depend upon enrollment and the availability of space for acting, constructing costumes, scenery, and properties. Theatre classes provide opportunities for both individual and group projects. For this reason, students working at two, three, or four different achievement levels may be accommodated in a single class if the enrollment is small. The instructional objectives provided in the following pages describe four sequential levels of student achievement."

School divisions and teachers have worked to incorporate the standards in local curriculum and classroom instruction. As part of the Board's seven-year cycle, the review process occurred again in 2008 and resulted in the standards contained in this document.

          "Art GLEs are grade level benchmarks for the Fine Arts Content Standards in the Show-Me Standards for Missouri Schools. It is expected that 80% of students will demonstrate proficiency at the GLE level. As school district's build curriculum documents, it is understood that concepts and skills should be introduced at earlier grade levels, assessed at the GLE level, and continue to be reviewed/reinforced at later grade levels. At each grade level, students should be able to demonstrate the GLEs from previous years as well as those specified for the current grade. Emphasis is placed on skill refinement and increasing control of each media. Students are expected to grow in their ability to select art ma-terials which are best suited for creatively communicating their ideas."

Health education in schools can effectively enable students to develop the knowledge and skills they need to reduce health risks, while simultaneously enhancing their academic achievement. Positive health behaviors initiated early in life should decrease the possibility of disease, disability, and premature death later in life. Far too many young people die in the District of Columbia because of unintentional injuries or as the result of violent behavior. Too many others compromise their well-being through unhealthy behaviors, such as using alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs. Comprehensive health education will equip our students with the knowledge and skills they need to advance personal, family, school, and community health."

The Health Education and Physical Education Standards will guide instruction that will help students make better decisions about their health. Through achievement of the Health Education and Physical Education Standards, students learn that their decisions can affect their health and set a pattern for their lives.

          "Career and Education Development helps all students gain the knowledge, skills and behaviors to interact with others, set goals and make decisions related to career, college and citizenship. Success in the 21st century differs significantly from the 20th-century model. Lifelong employment with a single employer has virtually vanished. Success today is increasingly dependent on a sophisticated knowledge base, the ability to enhance that base, collaborate, self-direct and adapt to change. Individuals will need to alter their goals and decisions over their lifetimes in relation to school and workplace requirements and personal responsibilities. As part of Career and Education Development, students must see education as a continuous lifelong process that will prepare them for and make them adaptable in a complex, information-rich and fast-changing world."

Standard B describes the processes of scientific inquiry and technological design. As a complement to the expectations of inquiry and design outlined in Standard B, Standard C describes the enterprises of science and technology and the connection to society. Standards D and E have performance indicators that encompass the subject matter conventionally referred to as life, physical, and earth and space science. It is essential that classroom instruction integrate the processes and ideas of Standards A, B, and C with the knowledge of Standards D and E, rather than teach them separately."

The RI science GSEs encompass the content eligible for inclusion on the large-scale assessment of science in grades 4, 8, and 11. They are not intended to represent the full science curriculum at each grade span, but are meant to capture the \"major ideas\" of science that can be assessed in an on-demand setting. The goal is that the science GSEs focus the curriculum, but do not restrict it. The science GSEs are written for grade spans K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and high school. They describe the science knowledge and abilities students should demonstrate at the end of each grade span. Since the large-scale high school science assessment is given near the end of grade 11, the GSEs for high school for all students are aligned with the content for the assessment."

          "The primary purpose of social studies is to develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world (National Council of the Social Studies, 1994, p.3). The great architects of American public education, such as Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, and John Dewey, believed that every student must be well versed in our nation's history, the principles and practices which undergird citizenship, and the institutions that define our government. Understandings of commerce and geography were critical to their thinking as well. In essence, Jefferson, Mann, and Dewey viewed the study of social studies as critical to the mission of public schools. Indeed, they would applaud the inclusion of a \"responsible and involved citizen\" in the Guiding Principles, as well as social studies as one of eight content areas in the Learning Results."

The Physical Education Core Curriculum utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of movement forms such as sports, dance, and recreational and physical fitness activities. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students, and not just for those who are \"physically gifted.\" The Physical Education Core represents a shift from a team sports-dominated program to a lifetime activity format with connections to community resources. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and the benefits of a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the Physical Education Core. Reading and writing practices such as reports, activity journals, and portfolios are incorporated in the Core to broaden the physical education experience and to contribute to the overall literacy of students. Students develop life skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation and learn to value academic service experiences."

          "The Career Development Framework is a tool for state, regional, and local curriculum planning. This tool can be used as a means to assess the integration of career development within the existing curriculum as well as the overall career development of individuals. In many school districts, individual career development assessments will contribute to and culminate in a Competency Based Transcript, reflecting an individual's learning and progress. This framework will be used at the local level as a guide for making decisions about the design of curriculum, the delivery of instruction, and the development of classroom, school and district assessments. Educators, school board members, and citizens are encouraged to work cooperatively to develop local career education programs. The overall approach used should be cumulative, with learnings at each grade level providing the foundation for future learning and development in the areas of career awareness, experience, and planning. In summary, this framework is designed to be used as a systematic guide for integrating the processes of career development within local school districts' overall curriculum plans."

The committee structured the standards in a way so that any grade level/content area could pursue a goal of proficiency for their students. The idea being that students in the fourth grade could reach a level of proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level, while students in the ninth grade could reach proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level. Additionally, theatre standards are written and organized in a way that both theatre and non-theatre educators can access, integrate, and utilize them in a variety of instructional settings."

          "The Nebraska K-12 Physical Education Essential Learnings are intended to reflect what students should know and be able to do by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 as a result of participating in a quality physical education program. They are organized in grade level clusters of K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12, and they are composed of three overarching themes: Physical Education Literacy, Physical Activity and Fitness, and Responsible Physical Activity Behavior. Within each of these themes are two unique topic strands for a total of six topic strands. These strands are aligned to the National Standards for Physical Education and are articulated throughout the Physical Education Essential Learnings. The overarching themes and topic strands are identified to help organize the essential learnings. Within each strand are one or more essential learnings reflecting what students should know and be able to do at the end of each grade level range (e.g., K-2)."

          "The NH Minimum Standards for Public School Approval require that elementary and middle/junior high school students \"acquire knowledge and understanding of civics, economics, geography, and history\" and require that high school students \"acquire knowledge and modes of inquiry\" in the same four subjects \"including the related areas of sociology, anthropology, and psychology.\" Using this framework, districts can be assured they are guided by the best understandings as to what should be included in social studies courses for the 21st century. In the future, social studies assessments may be developed for the state of New Hampshire that will be based on this framework and should reflect \"best practices in New Hampshire\"."

They take into account the growing population of language minority children who are learning English as a second language. Further, they acknowledge the need for the development of an academic program, a program that fully integrates second language instruction with other content areas. This is paramount if students are to achieve significant improvement in programs that teach a second language through cognitively complex content taught through problem-solving and discovery learning in highly interactive classroom activities. All students will, indeed, learn a second language most effectively through content instruction and when afforded an extended, continuous, and uninterrupted time period in which to do so."

They are not intended to represent the full science curriculum at each grade span, but are meant to capture the \"major ideas\" of science that can be assessed in an on-demand setting. The goal is that the science GSEs focus the curriculum, but do not restrict it. The science GSEs are written for grade spans K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and high school. They describe the science knowledge and abilities students should demonstrate at the end of each grade span. Since the large-scale high school science assessment is given near the end of grade 11, the GSEs for high school for all students are aligned with the content for the assessment."

The RI science GSEs encompass the content eligible for inclusion on the large-scale assessment of science in grades 4, 8, and 11. They are not intended to represent the full science curriculum at each grade span, but are meant to capture the \"major ideas\" of science that can be assessed in an on-demand setting. The goal is that the science GSEs focus the curriculum, but do not restrict it. The science GSEs are written for grade spans K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and high school. They describe the science knowledge and abilities students should demonstrate at the end of each grade span. Since the large-scale high school science assessment is given near the end of grade 11, the GSEs for high school for all students are aligned with the content for the assessment."

They provide clarity of purpose, set high and challenging expectations for all students, and ensure that Health Education is emphasized from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. The standards do not prescribe a particular curriculum, nor do they subscribe to any one method or approach to teaching. They serve as a map for schools to develop their own framework from which teachers can examine and improve their teaching and students' learning."

In this way they help to demystify teaching, learning, and assessment by making public what, why, and how students need to learn and teachers need to teach. Standards serve as clear and consistent targets of performance and serve as reference points for aligning all parts of the educational system—its policies, programs, classroom practices, and curricular support.

          "Kansas' schools have a long history of providing physical education to students. Most school districts provide a very comprehensive physical education program, K-12. Research has shown that planned, sequential instruction in physical education promotes lifelong physical activity. A comprehensive physical education program is designed to develop basic movement skills, sports skills, and physical fitness as well as to enhance mental, social and emotional activities. Further research has shown that physical activity among adolescents is consistently related to higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of anxiety and stress. Physical activity is also positively associated with academic performance. Students who participate in school physical education programs do not experience any harmful effects on their standardized test scores, though less time is available for other academic subjects."

ITEA defines technological literacy as \"The ability to use, manage, understand, and assess technology.\" As evidenced in the final report of the Visionary Panel for Better Schools, teachers must have access to a precise and challenging curriculum, one that is uniform in content and expectations and fully aligned with state standards. Additionally, teachers must have the technical assistance and support they need to translate curriculum into effective, individualized instruction.

The standards are designed to guide the planning of instruction and to anchor the assessment of learning from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Performance descriptors bridge the content standards to assessments of the standards, provide information to teachers and students regarding student progress toward mastery of the standards, and specify targets for instruction and learning. The document presents a starting point for informed dialogue among those dedicated and committed to quality education in South Dakota. By providing a common set of goals and expectations for all students in all schools, this dialogue will be strengthened and enhanced."

The four levels (basic, proficient, advanced, and exemplary) loosely correspond to the number of theatre courses a student has taken. Introduction to theatre is recommended at the Pre-K level. However, it is important to realize that in classroom application, the progression of benchmarks may apply over virtually any sequence of grades. Benchmarks at each level build upon those from previous levels, but do not replace them."

It is the active process of investigation and the critical review of evidence related to the world around us, both visible and invisible. Science is a dynamic process of gathering and evaluating information, looking for patterns, and then devising and testing possible explanations. Active engagement in scientific investigation leads students to think critically and to develop reasoning skills that allow them to become independent, lifelong learners. Science methods and thought processes have application well beyond the bounds of science and support learning goals in all subject areas."

The arts are often asked to express that which cannot be expressed through words. The Priority Academic Student Skills (PASS) suggest benchmarks in the understanding of the arts for all students. Why is it important for each student to understand the significance of the arts in a historical, cultural, or aesthetic sense? Should students be encouraged to create meaningful, interpretive, original, or creative expressions? Will meaningful arts instruction give students the confidence they need to explore and create at the very highest of educational standards? Anthropologists have found evidence of the use of art for purposes of discussion as early as 70,000 years ago. The arts that are created today will one day be our contribution to this ongoing discussion of the human experience."

In addition to involving students intellectually, personally, and emotionally, the knowledge of the content learned assists students in developing skills that will transfer to other disciplines and life situations. The competencies integrate production, problem solving, aesthetics, art history, criticism, and career opportunities in the visual arts.

Visual arts educators will use this rich array of content to design curriculum to enable students to meet these standards at different grade levels."

The ability to function competently in at least one language other than English has become increasingly important. One must be able to participate appropriately in face-to-face interaction with members of other societies. It is also necessary to interpret the concepts, ideas, and opinions of members of these societies, as expressed through their media and their literature. It is obvious that students only attain this ability when language study is initiated as early as possible and continued over an extended period of time. Futhermore, knowledge of the linguistic system of a given language—its grammar, vocabulary, and phonology-are important in supporting successful communication."

Thus, schools must help students acquire workplace skills by assisting them in developing the necessary intellectual abilities and personal traits that help them to secure and maintain employment in the business world. Schools should encourage students to use creative and critical thinking skills, which are transferrable from the classroom to the workplace and to the community. In the schools, these workplace skills must build upon the basic skills, higher order thinking, and the practice of personal qualities that emphasize such things as respect and responsibility. Also, these workplace skills need to be taught and understood in an environment that accurately represents the realities of today's workplace."

The standards in this document are based on previous North Dakota standards, national standards, and the standards from other states. Through discussion of the various sources and a consensus process, the writing team defined six standards that reflect the various disciplines of the visual arts and the unique nature of North Dakota."

They cover basic learning expectations including knowledge, skills, communication, thinking, understanding, and innovation. The first three commonalties (knowledge, skills, and communication) are most easily assessed with standardized tests. They are also easier to teach through direct instruction, rote learning, training, and guided practice. Because they are easier to teach and assess, they often make up the bulk of instruction in schools. The remaining three commonalties (thinking, understanding, and innovation) are not as easily assessed through standard measures and are not as easy to teach through direct instruction. Despite these challenges, many believe these areas are equally important components of a complete education."

Early initiation of healthy behaviors is a predictor of enhanced school performance as well as less risk for morbidity and premature mortality in adulthood. Health enhancement is a critical component of the educational process."

Students who select modern languages should be able to speak, read, write, and understand the foreign language they study; students who select a classical language should be able to read and understand the foreign language they study. In order to achieve these goals, it is recommended in this framework that students begin their language studies in the elementary grades and continue to study one or more languages throughout middle and high school."

Some may look at these standards and point out they are performance standards, not true content standards. However, the pure content of theatre is what is taught in history, language arts, science, and mathematics. What is unique to theatre is its active form. The standards also teach broader learning concepts. The skills of critical thinking, problem-solving, working with others, communication skills, and decision making are integral to every element of theatre and carry over into all of the other subject areas. Recent studies have shown that students who participate in the arts, especially theatre, do better academically, and are more successful in their career endeavors, than those who do not."

Recognizing this fact, these standards encourage the development of curriculum and instruction that make productive use of the emerging literacy abilities that children bring to school. Furthermore, the standards provide ample room for the innovation and creativity essential to teaching and learning. They are not prescriptions for particular curriculum or instruction."

          "Standards identify what students must know and be able to do. Thus, integration throughout the curriculum is the vision embedded in the fine arts standards. The standards support the self-actualization of each student by gradually building many kinds of literacy while developing intuition, reasoning, imagination, and dexterity into unique forms of expression and communication. The standards provide guidance to school district planning committees as they develop their local curriculum frameworks. The standards are intended to be dynamic statements, accessible to all students, and describe what students should know and be able to do as a result of their educational experiences."
