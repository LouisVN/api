The course should also emphasize the flexibility of the U.S. Constitution, and specifically the impact of additional amendments over time and their varying interpretations on both civil liberties and civil rights during the Twentieth Century. The thrust of the course should be the historical narrative of a people who persevered to give greater meaning to our founding creed and those founding American documents. This story would include the twentieth century social movements for greater freedom and equality led by and for various groups of Americans.

There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y).

The courses in this document are intended to help students build on the knowledge and skills they have developed in arts courses in Grades 9 and 10. Arts courses for the first two years of secondary school are designed to appeal to students' interests and imagination, and provide a basis for more intensive and specialized study. In all arts subjects in Grades 11 and 12, emphasis is placed on acquiring more advanced skills and applying them in more complex ways. An important aim of the Grade 11 and 12 courses is to help students understand the world in which they live and to help them make choices that will both enrich their lives and prepare them for a variety of careers. To this end, course content is designed to encourage students to understand the connections between what they are doing at the Grade 11 and 12 levels and what is required in a broad range of university and college programs and the world of work."],

Language programs thus equip students with skills that are essential for effective learning in other areas of the curriculum, as well as for further employment. Because language and culture are closely related, students will also learn to understand and appreciate other cultures.
